Q-methodology represents an innovative research approach to study attitudes of the stakeholders, however it is still not widely used in all disciplines. 
\
It obviously presents some advantages and disadvantages. 
For example, one of the main limitations is that the Q sorting is quite time-consuming and it needs to be carefully explained to participants, since they are not familiar with it and sometimes they could not exactly understand how to proceed: validity can be compromised by the misinterpretation of some items. 
\
Furthermore, Q methodology is limited only to small samples, therefore results can't be generalised to the rest of the population. 
At the same time, anybody can take part to a project on Q Methodology: although some participants may not have a specific idea about the topic, they can still share their perspective just from reading the statements and sorting them.
\
Compared to other approaches, Q-Method could be considered more accurate: it proposes a question and its respective answers, which are "already decided" by researchers. Whereas asking the same question without any given instruction -for example, during an interview- could let the stakeholders swerve from the question line,  Q Methodology leads people toward different paths, which are, however, limited according to the cards and it permits to study subjects' specific point of view accordingly, without deviating from the original goal. 
\
Finally, lots of individuals that took part to the project defined this new approach as "fun" and "amusing": overall, Q-Methodology gains its interesting role in the sociology research field, being not only an innovative and functional new way to study subjectivity for researcher, but also an enjoyable method for its public.
