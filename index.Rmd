## Introduction

## Methods


### Item Generation: Selection and Source of items   
  
As Stephenson suggests in his publication ‘Q methodology and the projective techniques’, a Q set *“may be composed of objects, statements, descriptions and behavior, traits, and the like” (1952: 223)*, hence there are many options of what can be used as an item. In our study we decided to select items that verbalize actions and therefore *behavior regarding our conceptualized scenario.*
In regard to this definition, we conceived items ourselves based on our own ingenuity with inspiration from the movie “The Groundhog Day”, researches on the internet platform Reddit on topics that seem alike, and asking friends and family.  
Whereas the “Groundhog Day” was our first source of inspiration, as it pictures quiet the similar mind game, Reddit was our main internet source, as it is a universally known and used website to find actions or reaction to certain sequences of events, whether fictional or non-fictional. The vast and various community ensures good items in term of *coverage and balance*, moreover it provides suggestion to other similar topics, that helped us forming the definite research question and plot.  
Gathering additive ideas among acquaintances firstly confirmed items, we had already gathered, which were supposed to be broadly representative of the opinion of the general population (Watts and Stenner 2012: 58) and secondly also had the aim to get a feeling for whether our repository of items covered enough ground within our concept or adding different ideas and propositions would be necessary to generate a balanced set of statements that allows participants of all persuasions to express their feelings equally (Baker et al. 170 f.).  
  
  
### Demographics and Selection of Participants  
  
Giving the nature of Q method, representing an inversion of the traditional R methodology, in which the Q set, therefore the items, constitutes the study sample and each participant becomes a variable, the recruitment should always be done carefully regarding the research question and whether the viewpoint of these people matters in relation to the subject (Watts and Stenner 2012: 70 f.). However, in our case study, we were not regimented by our topic, as it was universally appealing and we did not have any concepts of a *”particularly interesting or pivotal point of view”* (ibid.).
We had 36 participants, which were selected from 5 different set of acquaintances via opportunity sampling, while we still tried to frame the sampling as assorted as possible. 
Most of the people of the participant group were students from university or school, however from different disciplines.
The age of the participants ranges from 55 to 15, with an average age of 25,2 and a median of 22.5.
Almost the same number of females and males were asked, from which 16 stated to be engaged or in a relationship in the time of participating in the study.


```{r include = FALSE}
distro <- qmethod::make.distribution(nstat = 59, max.bin = 7)
names(distro) <- -7:7
# TODO there is a bug here; this should work without specifiyng chessboard, null should default fine
grid <- pensieve::as_psGrid(obj = distro, pattern = "chessboard")
```


### Experiences in the field  
  
Doing this study as a first encounter with Q Method, there were various things to take into consideration and be mindful of, especially while supervising the procedure of the sorting that only later occurs to one as important and useful, while interpreting the factors, e.g. certain question that should have been asked or things that should have been put an emphasize on while instructing the participants. Details, one cannot think of, when not having enough practical experiences.
Nevertheless, elaborated prework, as pre-sorting personal information that might influence the participants’ viewpoints  might ease the path for a substantial interpretation (Watts and Stenner 2012: 75).  
During the pre-sorts of the items into the three piles (*“Items you disagree with”*, *“Items you do not understand or are ambivalent about”*, *“Items you agree with”*), the neutral pile was reportedly the biggest, with the remainder equally split, which might suggest, that our items were balanced.
Nonetheless, as some respondents noted that some items were similar, especially on the sex related questions, it should be taken into consideration, whether the balance of the items, could be dependent on the age of the participants, because especially older and younger participants, noted that there were too many sex-related questions.
Even if that was the case, it is still not ensured, whether there were in fact top many questions regarding sexuality or it was more of an act of social desirability for participant to comment on that, as it might defuse the awkwardness of sorting these items under observation. 
Even though many people already complained about the number of items (our number of 59 items were in the average of the recommended number by Stephenson), most of the participants were, nonetheless, highly interested in the method itself, because by ranking the items and actually placing the cards, they were actively more involved, than for example in an one-to-one interview. This can be explained by what Professor O.J. Harvey from the University of Colorado describes as “one of psychology’s most basic and well established principles” ( 1997: 146 f.), which Watts and Stenner describe as our desire to see structure within, and to ascribe meaning to almost every stimuli and event (2012: 66). 
Furthermore, the participants were eager to explain their choices, while this can be, again, affiliated to social desirability it also could be ingénue interest on the topic, showing that our study is entitled.  
Regarding the correlation between members of a certain peer groups, even though they seem to agree on many items as expected, they do not necessarily have the same motivation behind it.
One might say: Just because some people placed the same item on the same ranking, it does not mean they have the same motivation in doing so and agree with each other on a moral code.  
In contrast to that, partners in a relationship, however, seem also to have similarities concerning non-sex- or relationship-related items in their sorting, even though relationship status, reportedly, forms the sorting concerning sex-related items such as: cheating, marrying, sexual fantasies, asking someone to have sex. 

```{r, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
items <- readr::read_csv(file = "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSkT1N44FpPcqAcAp1eChsHI0jlw-F0gqB7w1Sl4ksd6q3vNAoBbkjrx0rjlYc_7hhJiZ0uHvmxKRon/pub?gid=0&single=true&output=csv")
readr::write_rds(x = items, path = "items.rds")
```

```{r items, include = FALSE}
raw_items <- readr::read_rds(path = "items.rds")
items <- matrix(
  data = as.matrix(raw_items[,c("english", "german")]),
  nrow = nrow(raw_items),
  dimnames = list(items = raw_items$shorthandle, languages = c("english", "ngerman"))
)
# write out hashes and df
hash_de <- sapply(X = items[, "ngerman"], FUN = function(x) {
  digest::digest(object = x, algo = "crc32", serialize = FALSE)
})
hash_en <- sapply(X = items[, "english"], FUN = function(x) {
  digest::digest(object = x, algo = "crc32", serialize = FALSE)
})
input_helper_df <- data.frame(
  full_en = items[,"english"],
  full_de = items[,"ngerman"],
  handle = rownames(items),
  hash_en = hash_en,
  hash_de = hash_de
)
readr::write_csv(x = input_helper_df, path = "input_helper.csv")
```

## Field Work



Participants were given the following prompt:

> Imagine that, starting now, the next week will repeat itself once.
> In a week, the whole universe will rewind to today, all changes are undone and memories erased.
> You are the only person who knows this, and you alone will remember what happened during this week.
> What would you do?
>
> Rank the following items according to your likelihood for enacting them in the next week.
> Rank all activities highly which you like, even if you could not complete them all in the given time.
>
> Remember that whatever you do in the next seven days would be completely undone at the end of the week; only your memories remain.


Or, in German:

> Stelle dir vor, dass sich die nächste Woche genau ein Mal wiederholt.
> Am Ende der Woche dreht sich die Zeit zurück auf den heutigen Tag. Alle Veränderungen sind revidiert und Erinnerungen gelöscht.
> Du bist die einzige Person, die über diese Wiederholung weiß und nur du kannst dich in Zukunft daran erinnern, was in der Woche passiert ist.
>
> Sortiere die folgenden Aktivitäten danach, wie wahrscheinlich du sie in der Woche durchführen würdest.
> Es ist nicht wichtig, ob du die präferierten Aktivitäten auch alle schaffen könntest.
>
> Denke daran, dass alle Änderungen im Universum am Ende der Woche rückgängig gemacht werden; nur deine Erinnerungen bleiben.


Participants were given the following sorting instructions:

> 1. Choose a pseudonym, so that you can recognize your own datapoints in the results.
    ![](img/pseudo.jpg)
> 1. Read through all the items carefully. 
     Make notes on the items if you like.
> 2. Preliminarily sort the items into three piles:
     1. Items you like.
     2. Items you do not understand or are ambivalent about.
     3. Items you dislike.
     ![](img/presort.jpg)
> 3. Rank-order the items according to how likely you are to do the described activities, from the right (likely to do) to the left (unlikely to do).
      Start with items from the right (likely to do), continue with items from the left (unlikely to do), and finally fill in the middle (ambivalent).
> 4. Consider your completed sort, and revise item positions if necessary.
      ![](img/sort.jpg)
> 5. Add comments to items you feel strongly about, or do not understand.
> 6. Turn all items on their back (only showing a random string), and ask the investigator to take a picture of your completed sort.

Participants were reminded:

> - There is no correct or consistent way to complete your Q sort; whatever you feel expresses your subjective view on the matter is correct. 
>   This is not a test - There is no "right answer".
> - Only the horizontal dimension (from left to right) matters; the vertical axis does not matter.
  Items on top of one another merely express ties.
> If you are ambivalent about an item or do not understand it, place it in the middle between the two extremes.
  This is valuable information, too.
> - You must place all items.
> - You must adhere to the distribution.
> - Only *relative* positions matter.
    For example, you may feel positively about *more* than half of the items, and have only very few neutral or negative items.


Important notes for **the investigators**:

- Remember to sample a *diverse* group of people who are likely to display *different* viewpoints on the subject matter.
- We are not going to gather *any* personal data.
  Make sure not to pollute the gathered data with any information that might deanonymize your participants.
  For example *do not* record their email adress on the cards, and make sure that their pseudonyms are properly anonymous.
  If you want to email the results to the participants, store their contact information *separately* and securely, with no reference to the study.
- **Make sure to test the photo you're taking at the end to record the sort**: 
    - Are the item codes legible? 
    - Is the lighting ok?
    - Is the resolution high enough?
    - Is the pseudonym card in the picture?
    - Save several copies of these images.
    - (If possible, delete date and location metadata from these images).
- There may be a tradeoff in our study between a) getting deep, qualitative insights from observing and discussing the sorting behavior and b) avoiding social desirability biases.
  Participants may not feel free to sort some items (e.g. anti-social and sexual), when they are closely observed, or know that the investigator (= you), will "know" their Q sort.
  (For this reason, the item backs are marked with arbitrary codes for identification, so that participants never have to "show" their sorts to the investigators.)
  It's not clear what we should do here, because on the other hand, we probably cannot produce proper anonymity in in-person sorts, and we may also want to closely observe and engage the participants.
- Take the time to carefully discuss the sorting procedure with participants after they are done.
  If you want to (see above caveat), also sit next to them while they sort and prompt them to explain their choices.
  **Take notes!**
- Remind participants to add feedback or any thoughts and comments to the items.
  They can write them on the cards.
  **Provide participants with pens or pencils.**
- When you are preparing the cards, make sure that every participant has a complete set (and no duplicates). 
  This can be quite difficult and requires *very* careful preparation (envelopes are useful).
- Explain the procedure very carefully to the participants, and **show them pictures of the completed sorts**.
  Otherwise, it can be quite hard to understand the methodology.
  In particular, remind them that only the horizontal axis matters, what the extremes are, and that they must adhere to the forced distribution.
- This procedure takes time and some quiet patience (> 60 minutes), as well as some space (e.g. a free table).
  Plan accordingly.
