The Q-Methodology represents an innovative research method used  in social sciences in order to study people’s point of view, that is to say, their subjectivity. It was introduced by psychologist William Stephenson (1902 – 1989)  and, even though the method is described mainly as qualitative, it offers a combination of both qualitative and quantitative aspects, through the analysis of factors emerged during the study.

>Most typically in Q, a person is presented with a set
>of statements about some topic, and is asked to rank-order
>them (usually from "agree" to "disagree"), an operation referred
>to as Q sorting. The statements are matters of opinion
>only (not fact), and the fact that the Q sorter is ranking the
>statements from his or her own point of view is what brings
>subjectivity into the picture (Brown 1993)

#### Our Story:


We are a group of five people: Eleni Sarri, Ngoc Tuyet Nhun, Patrick Hajjar, Valeria Scollo and our teacher and leader Maximilian Held. 

As the title says, this project starts with the question „Imagine you are in a time loop: what would you do?“  and it aims to study individual’s subjectivity accordingly. 
\
To begin with, our group proposed different topics that could represent the possible theme of the study:  however, some of them involved arguments such as death, catastrophes and, generally speaking, events that could dishearten the participants. Coming up with a satisfactory research question proved to be quite challenging : there are many different topics through which it is possible to study people’s point of view and opinions on everyday life matters  of our society like, for example, racism, feminism, money (…).  Since they mostly depends on personal background, culture and values, moral and ethical elements play an important role in the process of choosing the possible subject matter and, being the study of individuals’ point of view the goal of this project, to respect and to pay attention to their sensitiveness becomes a crucial priority for researchers.  
Through  brainstorm sessions and debates, we developed a -maybe unusual- topic: the so called “Groundhog” scenario. In this context, Q-Methodology becomes the best instrument that we have to study and to show  how people would react to an imaginary time loop that no one else is aware of and, to some extent, to understand their perceptions and opinions on a similar note.

There is obviously no right or wrong way to provide individuals’ point of view,

>Only subjective opinions are at issue in Q, 
>and although they are typically unprovable,
>they can nevertheless be shown to have structure and form, 
>and it is the task of Q-technique to make the form manifest for purposes of observation and study (Brown, 1986).
